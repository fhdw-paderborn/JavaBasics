/**
 * Exercise 2: Leap Year Verification
 * 
 * In this exercise, we need to verify if a year is a leap year.
 * This will use logical and relational operators as well as if-statements.
 * 
 * The rules for a leap year are:
 * 1. The year is divisible by 4
 * 2. Exception: If the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year
 * 3. Exception to the exception: If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year
